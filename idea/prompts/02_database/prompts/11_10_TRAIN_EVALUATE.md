# 10_TRAIN_EVALUATE — Baseline, model training and scientific evaluation

## Objective and background
You are implementing one bounded phase of RubiVision AI, a speedcubing web application with cloud persistence and experimental camera-based movement/pause analysis. This prompt is an implementation assignment, not a request for a proposal only. Do not attempt all phases at once.

## Detailed implementation assignment
Prepare deterministic feature tables; split by participant/session to avoid correlated windows crossing sets. Train threshold baseline and RandomForest or suitable tabular classifier; tune only on train/validation, freeze untouched held-out test. Define preprocessing, imputation, label IDs, seed, feature order and manifest. Evaluate both on identical test windows with per-class precision/recall/F1, macro F1, confusion matrix, uncertain rate, pause boundary error, processing latency and failure cases. Export a browser-compatible artifact only after validating runtime support; if unsupported, use baseline rather than pretend ML deployed. No invented metrics.

## Expected files and deliverables
Suggested paths (adapt to the actual repository): scripts/ml/, scripts/dataset/, docs/EVALUATION.md, artifacts/model-manifest.json, tests/ml/.

## Concrete acceptance gate
No split leakage; same held-out set; reproducible metrics; manifest matches runtime.

## Additional edge cases and integration checks
- Test a fresh account with no data, populated account, stale authentication, denied permissions where relevant, and malformed input.
- Preserve immutable scramble association and millisecond timing precision through the complete data flow.
- Validate ownership on the server, not only in React UI. Explicitly report any security behavior not tested.
- Ensure network failures do not masquerade as successful persistence; ensure camera and AI failures cannot corrupt timer or solve records.
- Record any mismatch between the original project specification and the Supabase-only architectural decision.
- Where this phase needs a real browser, real footage, a hosted Supabase project or labeled dataset, clearly distinguish automated evidence, manual evidence and unverified conditions.

## Suggested agent workflow
A. Inventory current implementation and existing tests.
B. Draft minimal data flow and interface changes; note dependencies.
C. Implement one cohesive vertical slice and SQL migration if needed.
D. Add unit, integration, security and end-to-end tests appropriate to scope.
E. Run checks, fix failures and document exact commands and output summaries.
F. Produce a handoff for the next phase without beginning unrelated work.

## Agent execution protocol — mandatory
1. Inspect the actual repository, package manager, versions, environment files (never print secrets), tests, schema migrations, and prior phase reports. Do not assume this project is empty.
2. Read docs/ARCHITECTURE_DECISIONS.md and reference/02_Supabase_PostgreSQL_Schema.md, plus the relevant original specification. If files are not copied into the repository, ask for their location; never silently ignore them.
3. Produce an inventory of existing vs missing functionality and a concrete file-level plan before editing. Implement the smallest complete vertical slice; preserve unrelated functionality.
4. Validate all input at boundaries; use strict TypeScript and typed repositories. Never put privileged Supabase credentials in browser code. Prefer existing dependencies; verify actual installed APIs.
5. Add deterministic unit tests, integration tests where applicable, negative tests and explicit UI error handling. Run available lint, typecheck, tests, production build, and relevant Supabase local checks. If unavailable, state why.
6. Do not claim measured accuracy, WCA certification, exact camera-derived moves, CFOP phases, successful database writes or test passes without evidence.
7. Deliver: changed files; design decisions; migrations and data impact; test commands and actual results; manual QA; remaining risks; handoff instructions. Update docs/PHASE_STATUS.md. Do not mark complete if acceptance criteria fail.
8. Do not use IndexedDB, OPFS databases, offline save queues, or client-side persistent solve storage. Supabase PostgreSQL is the only persistent application database. In-memory state is allowed but is volatile. Explain that offline timing works while saving does not.
